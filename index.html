        <span style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;"> Desert is an arid region
            characterised by extremely high or low temperatures and has scarce vegetation.
            Depending on the temperatures there can be hot deserts or cold deserts. The people inhabit these lands
            wherever little water is available to practise agriculture.</span>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <span style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">Mountains are prominent
            landforms that have significant heights above sea level and/or the surrounding
            land. They are steeper than hills. A mountain or mountain range usually has a peak, which is a pointed top.
            Mountains have different climates than land at sea level and nearby flat land</span>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <span style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">Seas are smaller than
                oceans and are usually located where the land and ocean meet. Typically, seas
                are partially enclosed by land. The Sargasso Sea is an exception. It is defined only by ocean
                currents.</span>

                <span style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">A galaxy is a huge
                    collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems. A
                    galaxy is held together by gravity. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, also has a supermassive black hole in
                    the middle. </span>
